# tiny-lastfm-analyzer  
A project for www programming course.  
It's a simple lastfm analyzer, that allows the user to show a summary of their scrobbles data from a specified period of time. It has two modes: monthly and yearly. The first one groups data into months and the latter into years.  
The data requested by the frontend is fetched and processed by my backend ([repo link](https://github.com/grips8/tiny-lastfm-analyzer-backend)).  
The animations are done with framer motion, and http requests with axios.  

It should be available at: https://tiny-lastfm-analyzer.up.railway.app/  
(Unless I run out of railway free tier credits lol)
